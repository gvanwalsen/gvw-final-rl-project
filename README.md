# Final Reinforcement Learning Project
This repository presents the code for my final Reinforcement Learning project, Utilization of Deep Q Learning for Residential HVAC Temperature Control. This code is written in MATLAB, and utilizes Simulink, Simscape, the MATLAB Reinforcement Learning Toolbox, along with other standard toolboxes. 
The project is primarily based on two different publically available MATLAB example projects: "House Heating System" and "Train DQN Agent with LSTM Network to Control House Heating System".

Though much of the code is assembled to follow these examples, minor edits were made for relevance to this final project and the associated requirements. 
The intended goal of this implementation is to demonstrate improved performance of a DQN controlled thermostat compared to a standard setpoint thermostate for a simple Residential Heating System.
